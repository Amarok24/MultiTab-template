# MultiTab Template
A very simple "plugin" for multi-tab page content (navigation + corresponding content).
All content is shown if JavaScript is disabled (useful for legacy browsers or accessibility readers).

## Note
index.html needs to run in a live-server environment (because JS modules are used).
